html-query-plan
====================

This is a utility for transforming XML query execution plans into HTML via XSLT.

The stylesheet is completely XSLT 1.0 compatible, and with the exception of the lines (which are drawn using HTML 5 canvas) the output is all HTML + CSS.

The icons used are adapted from the Fat Cow "Farm Fresh" web icons pack, which can be found at (http://www.fatcow.com/free-icons).  (Unfortunately some of the adapting was done by myself and I'm no artist - I apologise unreservedly for mangling someone elses masterpiece)
